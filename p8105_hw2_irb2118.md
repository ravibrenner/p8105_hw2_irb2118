# Introduction

This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 2.

# Methods

The data for this homework comes from the course website, but all files
can be found in the `data/` folder. Additionally, we will be using
packages from the `tidyverse` and `readxl`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Problems

## Problem 1

This problem is about the NYC subway system.

First, we must read in the data, clean up the column names, and select
and transform the columns that we need:

``` r
subway_df <-
  read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line,
    station_name,
    station_latitude,
    station_longitude,
    route1:route11,
    entry,
    vending,
    entrance_type,
    ada
  ) |>
  mutate(entry = case_match(entry,
                            "YES" ~ TRUE,
                            "NO" ~ FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

This dataset contains data on each entrance and exit for each subway
line and station (name and geographic location), and the routes that
operate at the line and station (for example, some stops accomodate
multiple trains on the same line, like the NQRW or the 123). There are
additional variables indicating the entrance type, presence of vending
machines, and ADA compliance.

So far, I imported the data using `read_csv`, cleaned up the column
names using `janitor::clean_names`, selected the relevant columns using
`select`, and transformed the `entry` column from character to logical.
After these steps, there are 1868 rows and 19 columns.

There are 465 distinct stations. Of those, 84 are ADA compliant. Of the
station entrances/exits without vending, 69 out of 183 allow entrance,
or 37.7 percent.

Now, I will reformat the data from wide to long, into proper tidy
format:

``` r
subway_df <- subway_df |>
  mutate(across(.cols = route8:route11,
                as.character)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = route1:route11,
               names_to = "route_number",
               values_to = "route_name",
               names_prefix = "route") |>
  drop_na(route_name)
```

#### How many distinct stations serve the A train?

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of those, 17 are
ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

First we have to read in and clean the data for Mr. Trash Wheel. Then we
will follow a similar process for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and
eventually combine them all into one tidy data set. First, Mr. Trash
Wheel:

``` r
mr_trash_wheel <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                             range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
         year = as.numeric(year),
         name = "mr_trash_wheel") 
```

And repeat the same process for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda Trash
Wheel:

``` r
prof_trash_wheel <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                             range = "A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(name = "prof_trash_wheel")

gwyn_trash_wheel <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                             range = "A2:L157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(name = "gwyn_trash_wheel")
```

Now, combining all the datasets:

``` r
trash_wheels <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel,prof_trash_wheel,gwyn_trash_wheel)
```

With these 3 trash wheel datasets combined, there are 845 rows (584 for
Mr. Trash Wheel, 106 for Professor Trash Wheel, and 155 for Gwynnda
Trash Wheel) and 15 columns. Observations range from 1900-01-20 to
2023-06-30. Inspecting the data carefully, that date from 1900 appears
to be an error in the original source excel sheet, not an issue in the
data import process, so it could be worth asking the original data
producer what that date should be. It appears to be a date in January
2020, but it’s unclear which day. The true earliest date in the dataset
is 2014-05-16.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash wheel was 216.26
tons over a period from 2017-01-02 to 2023-06-29.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June, 2022
was 18120.
